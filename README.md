Design a multi-class classifier to detect adulterant present in milk sample

Problem statement:

You are given with data of different milk samples' spectrum. The spectrum ranges from 1831 cm-1 to 939 cm-1.

The milk samples have different fat percentages. For each fat percentage milk sample, varying percentage of adulterant is added.

Adulterants used are Urea, Sucrose, Starch, Neutralizer, Maltose, Maltodextrin, Glucose, Fructose, Formalin, Detergent, Ammonium Sulphate and Added Water.

For this given data, design a multi-class classifier that detects the adulterant present in milk sample, if it is adulterated, otherwise gives output as unadulterated.

Please see Evaluation and Data description for more information.
